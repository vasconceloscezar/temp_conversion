## Temperature conversion

A Rust CLI program to convert values from Celsius > Fahrenheit and vice-versa.

### Learnings

With this project, I could dive a bit deeper on rust `functions` and some different `types`. Also used a `while loop`

## Want to try it?

- Clone repo
- Install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- Run the following commands:

```
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

Enjoy.
